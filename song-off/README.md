# Introduction

"Song Off" is a site where people come to put their music knowledge to the test, and compete against their friends. In the beginning, a random theme is selected and presented to the players. The players then select a song that they feel best fits the selected theme. The choices are then forwarded to an AI judge which then chooses which of the selections it determines is the best fit, and awards the winner points.

# Tech Stack

Backend: TODO

# What I've learned so far

-setting up a proper react project structure (components, pages, assets)

-constructing pages by rendering individual modular components within them respectively
    - this keeps components modular and reusable, while not complicating App.js

-implementing react-router-dom as BrowserRouter and using routes to setup a single page application (SPA)
