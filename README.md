# Song Off

# Introduction

"Song Off" is a site where people come to put their music knowledge to the test, and compete against their friends. In the beginning, a random theme is selected and presented to the players. The players then select a song that they feel best fits the selected theme. The choices are then forwarded to an AI judge which then chooses which of the selections it determines is the best fit, and awards the winner points.
