# Song Off

# Introduction

"Song Off" is a site where people come to put their music knowledge to the test, and compete against their friends. In the beginning, a random theme is selected and presented to the players. The players then select a song that they feel best fits the selected theme. The choices are then forwarded to an AI judge which then chooses which of the selections it determines is the best fit, and awards the winner points.

## What I’ve Learned So Far

1. **Setting up a proper React project structure**
   - Organizing files into `components`, `pages`, and `assets`.

2. **Constructing pages using modular components**
   - Pages are composed of reusable components.
   - This keeps components modular while preventing `App.js` from becoming cluttered.
   - Follows single-page application (SPA) best practices.

3. **Implementing client-side routing with `react-router-dom`**
   - Using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, `Route`, and `Link` for navigation.

4. **Using layouts and the `Outlet` component**
   - Implementing child routes within a layout component.
   - Applying layout-specific structure and styling to groups of routes.
